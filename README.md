## What have we built? 
I have developed a platform for a community-built knowledge-hub like quora based on consensus learning, but with responses generated by multiple LLMs and consensus verified using statistical techniques. The Consensus responses to questions are verified and date and time stamped and stored permanentsly on a decentralised blockchain storage system so that the cumulative knowledge becomes a valuable repository or intellectual capital or a public good.
Overtime, this platform can potentially evolve to be a highly relaiable medical repository where doctors and healthcare providers can look up highly professional medical issue related queries for diagnosis and treatment, and can rely with a high confidence interval on the consensus responses. This innovation makes this verifiable AI tool really useful for even medical novices as it eliminates the serious issue of unreliability and hallucinations and wild extrapolations that the LLMs can be prone to oftentimes. 
Similarly, this verifiable AI took can be used across a myriad domains in technology, science, scientific discovery, manufacturing, STEM fields, education, health, and even mundane things like consumer goods.
